# Android and iOS Build Issues - Analysis and Solutions

## Android Build Errors

### Issue Found
The Android builds are failing with Java version compatibility issues:
```
error: invalid source release: 21
```

### Root Cause
Capacitor 7.4.2 defaults to using Java 21, but the GitHub Actions CI environment uses Java 17, causing a compatibility mismatch.

### Fix Applied
Updated Java compatibility settings in two key files:

1. **capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/build.gradle**:
   - Changed from Java 21 to Java 17
   - This affects Cordova plugin compilation

2. **app/build.gradle**:
   - Added explicit Java 17 compatibility override
   - This ensures the main app compiles with Java 17

### Changes Made
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

## iOS Build Requirements

### Current Status
iOS builds are working correctly until the code signing step, where they fail with:
```
Signing for "App" requires a development team. Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities editor.
```

### Required Setup for iOS Builds

#### 1. Apple Developer Account
- **Required**: An active Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- **Purpose**: Code signing and app distribution

#### 2. Repository Secrets Configuration
Add these secrets to GitHub repository settings:

| Secret Name | Description | Required |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_P12` | Developer certificate in P12 format | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `APPLE_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for P12 certificate | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` | App provisioning profile | ‚úÖ Yes |

#### 3. How to Obtain Required Items

**Apple Team ID**:
1. Log into Apple Developer Portal
2. Go to Membership section
3. Copy the Team ID (10-character string)

**Developer Certificate (P12)**:
1. In Xcode, go to Preferences > Accounts
2. Select your Apple ID and team
3. Manage Certificates > Create new Development certificate
4. Export certificate as P12 file
5. Convert to base64: `base64 -i certificate.p12 -o certificate.txt`

**Provisioning Profile**:
1. In Apple Developer Portal, create an App ID
2. Create a Development/Distribution Provisioning Profile
3. Download the .mobileprovision file
4. Convert to base64: `base64 -i profile.mobileprovision -o profile.txt`

#### 4. Workflow Configuration
The current iOS workflow is correctly configured but will only succeed with proper signing credentials.

#### 5. Alternative: Build Without Signing
For testing purposes, you can modify the workflow to build without signing:
- Change from `archive` to `build` action
- Remove code signing steps
- This produces an unsigned app for testing only

## Testing Status

### Android
- ‚úÖ Java compatibility fixed
- ‚úÖ Build configuration updated
- üü® Network connectivity issues in CI (Google repositories)
- üìã Requires testing in CI environment

### iOS
- ‚úÖ Build process works correctly
- ‚úÖ Dependencies install properly
- ‚ùå Requires Apple Developer account setup
- üìã Needs code signing configuration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test Android fixes**: Push changes and verify Android builds succeed
2. **Document iOS requirements**: Inform team about Apple Developer account needs
3. **Consider workflow adjustments**: May need to add retry logic for network issues

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Apple Developer Account**: Required for iOS app distribution
2. **Code Signing Strategy**: Set up automated signing for releases
3. **Network Reliability**: Monitor CI builds for intermittent network issues

## Network Issues Observed
During testing, encountered DNS resolution failures for `dl.google.com`:
- This affects Android SDK and dependency downloads
- May be intermittent CI environment issue
- Consider adding retry logic to workflows if persistent
